        Hello, I am Ahmet AJDE, an experienced developer in the software
        industry. I graduated from high school and have never attended
        university, as it was not something I desired. Since my final year in
        high school, I have dedicated myself to constantly improving in the
        world of software development. Throughout my career, I have always
        aspired to establish my own company and work there. I started as a
        Frontend Full Stack developer and embarked on numerous projects,
        enhancing my knowledge and skills in software development. Currently, I
        am working as a Frontend developer in a private company. During this
        time, I have been involved in various projects using significant
        technologies like artificial intelligence. Additionally, I have focused
        on collaborating with my team to create innovative solutions and elevate
        customer satisfaction. As a passionate individual in the software world,
        I stay updated on industry developments, adapt to new technologies, and
        strive to further enhance my skills. I aim for success both individually
        and as part of a team, utilizing the knowledge acquired from
        certificates and various training sources. I enjoy connecting with other
        software professionals, engaging in idea exchanges, and actively
        participate in industry events and conferences. Every new day in the
        software world is an opportunity for learning, and I am excited about
        the journey to achieve greater success. If you have any questions,
        please feel free to contact me. Best regards, Ahmet AJDE
